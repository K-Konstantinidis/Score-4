# Score-4
The Score-4 game.

This is a java project. There are 7 different classes and the game is the original Connect 4. 
If you do not know the game rules here is a link: https://www.gamesver.com/the-rules-of-connect-4-according-to-m-bradley-hasbro/

After you run the main method, the game starts and you can type in the console to play.
The game ends either if someone wins or if there is a draw.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
